Hello world, I'm Faus

I have a backgournd in Sociology and have done some certifications in data analysis. Currently I'm interested in analyzing qualitative data or related to human behaviour and interactions. I would like to learn more about Python and it's applications, specially in automation. Happy to chat about any of the subjects
